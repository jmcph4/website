    <p>For some coursework I'm currently undertaking, I've had to read a paper entitled <cite>Learning to Fuzz from Symbolic Execution with Application to Smart Contracts</cite>[<a href="{{ post.url }}#ref-1">1</a>] in order to prepare a seminar presentation for assessment.</p>
    <p>As such, I've decided to typeset the handwritten notes I took as I read through the entirety of the paper.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Smart contracts are stateful</li>
            <li>Each transaction consists of</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Contract function (with arguments)</li>
                <li>Address of caller</li>
                <li>Gas sent to contract</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Statefulness hinders automated testing</li>
            <li>Often deep states</li>
            <ul>                
                <li>Require long sequences of transactions to reach them</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Due to preconditions, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Limits code coverage</li>
